# Predictive Model for Employee Attrition

## Overview

This repository contains a predictive model for employee attrition, developed using Python. The goal of this project is to assist HR departments in identifying potential factors leading to employee turnover and to predict the likelihood of attrition. This insight enables companies to take proactive measures to retain valuable staff and improve the workplace environment.

## Objectives

- To analyze employee data and identify key factors contributing to attrition.
- To develop a machine learning model that can predict the probability of an employee leaving the company.
- To provide actionable insights to HR teams for improving employee retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various employee attributes such as age, department, job satisfaction, years at the company, etc. Note: The dataset is fictional and used for demonstration purposes only.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager


### Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks in the repository to explore the data analysis and model building process.
